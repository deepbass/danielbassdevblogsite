I saw the .dev domains go on sale and immediately had to buy one. I've not decided yet what I'm going to put on here, but I'm enjoying experimenting with GatsbyJS - and therefore React. I'm hosting it serverlessly on Azure Storage Static Site Hosting and deploying it using Azure DevOps, which I'll do a blog post on soon.

In general I think I will cover serverless development, and possibly some DevOps and MLOps. It will be focused on Microsoft Azure, as that's the cloud provider I'm familiar with. I'm also passionate about the FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) movement so I will possibly post about that too.
